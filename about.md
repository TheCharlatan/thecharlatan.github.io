My work is focused on Bitcoin Core development and sponsored by
[spiral](https://spiral.xyz). I have a major in computer science and a minor in
physics from the university of Zurich. I like greyhounds, bitcoin, food,
[reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) and the [guix linux
distribution](http://guix.gnu.org/).
